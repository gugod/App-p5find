NAME

    App::p5find - A collection of programs for locating certain constructs
    in Perl5 code.

DESCRIPTION

    This distribution provides a collection of programs that search through
    Perl5 code structure for certain patterns. Such as: string literals
    with interpolations, bareword tokens, vairable in method names.

    While those code patterns may be discoverable with sufficient amount of
    ack/grep-fu, this projects aims to reduce the amount of false recalls
    to the point that it becomes usefull for tasks such as hunting for
    anti-patterns.

The p5find command

    This distribution gives you a dozen of commands, all named like
    p5find-something, as well as master command name just p5find. The
    command name usually refer to a type of object or code pattern that can
    be located by running that command. For example, p5find-num would list
    up all number literals, while p5find-str would list up all string
    literals.

    Except for a few special ones, running all p5find commands would start
    iterating all perl source find under current working directory then
    looking for the specified code pattern.

    For example, to locate string literals, run: p5find str (or
    p5find-str). To see all options of the command, pass -h. Or for
    slightly more reading materials, run perldoc p5find-str.

    Conventionally the documentation all p5find commands can be revealed by
    invoking it with -h, or by running perldoc on it.

    To start understanding the usages of p5find, run: p5find help, or
    p5find-help
