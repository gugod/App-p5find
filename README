NAME

    App::p5find - A collection of programs for locating certain constructs
    in Perl5 code.

DESCRIPTION

    This distribution provides a collection of programs that search through
    Perl5 code structure for certain patterns. Such as: string literals
    with interpolations, bareword tokens, vairable in method names.

    While those code patterns may be discoverable with sufficient amount of
    ack/grep-fu, this projects aims to reduce the amount of false recalls
    to the point that it becomes usefull for tasks such as hunting for
    anti-patterns.
